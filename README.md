# Activity 1 – Python Inventory System

## Description
This program is a simple **Inventory Management System** written in Python.  
It uses the following data structures:

- **List** – stores item names  
- **Dictionary** – stores item prices, where the item name acts as the key  

The program runs in a loop and displays a menu that allows the user to:

### 1️. Add a New Item
- Prompts the user for an item name and price  
- Checks for duplicates  
- Adds the item to both the list and dictionary if it does not already exist  

### 2️. Update an Existing Item's Price
- Prompts for the item name  
- If the item exists, allows the user to update its price  
- If it does not exist, displays an error message  

> **Note:** The system does **not** support deleting items or marking items as out of stock.

## 💡 Features
- Prevents duplicate items  
- Error Handling
- Uses Python lists and dictionaries for data storage
